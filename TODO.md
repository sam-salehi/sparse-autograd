Batch training setup:
Setup mat mul
    - Extend matmul.py to handle multiplication
    - Make tests of different matrix dimensions to make sure the changes work properly
    - train on unmodified train.py. Should still work.
Add batches to training
    - Just modify train.py
    - Test to see if anything changes.

And then train on large batch baby.
